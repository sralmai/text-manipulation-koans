# text-manipulation-koans

## Criteria for being "fluent" with a text editor, borrowed from The Pragmatic Programmer

* When editing text, move and make selections by character, word, line, and paragraph.
* When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules, ...)
* Reindent code following changes.
* Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command.
* Undo and redo changes.
* Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them.
* Navigate to a particular line number.
* Sort selected lines.
* Search for both strings and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches.
* Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel.
* Display compilation errors in the current project.
* Run the current project's tests.
